Description: Note that archivist2 is a new incarnation of archivist. 
    Both can operate on same repositories, however archivist2 has simplified interface.
    Data exploration and modelling is a process in which a lot of data
    artifacts are produced. Artifacts like: subsets, data aggregates, plots,
    statistical models, different versions of data sets and different versions
    of results. The more projects we work with the more artifacts are produced
    and the harder it is to manage these artifacts. Archivist2 helps to store
    and manage artifacts created in R. Archivist2 allows you to store selected
    artifacts as a binary files together with their metadata and relations.
    Archivist2 allows to share artifacts with others, either through shared
    folder or github. Archivist2 allows to look for already created artifacts by
    using it's class, name, date of the creation or other properties. Makes it
    easy to restore such artifacts. Archivist2 allows to check if new artifact
    is the exact copy that was produced some time ago. That might be useful
    either for testing or caching.
